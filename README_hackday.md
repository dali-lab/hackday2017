# Overview
Slack is a popular and powerful communication and organizational tool for teams. We wanted to leverage two key features of Slack – integrations and file sharing – to make it an even more helpful tool. We listen for the Github integration and file uploads within a team's channel and aggregate the data into a timeline. The team can then view their progress over time in our web app.

# Architecture
- node.js
- firebase
